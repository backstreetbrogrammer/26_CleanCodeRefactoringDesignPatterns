### Chapter 01. Clean Code

Bad code:

```
Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.set(123, 5, 26, 0, 0, 0);
c.add(13, 60); // adds one minute
new Service().wish(c.getTime());
```

Clean code:

```
final LocalDate birthdayDate = LocalDate.of(2023, Month.JUNE, 26);
final LocalTime birthdayWishTime = LocalTime.of(0, 1, 0); // hh:mm:ss
new BirthdayWishService().wish(LocalDateTime.of(birthdayDate, birthdayWishTime));
```

"The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can
understand them clearly." ~ **Donald Knuth**

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
~ **Martin Fowler**

"We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code... Therefore, making it easy to read makes
it easier to write." ~ **Robert Martin**

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
~ **John Woods**

**Dirty code consequences**

- More bugs: as the code is not testable
- Decreased productivity: as the code is not maintainable
- Lower job satisfaction: more time spent on reading or understanding the code and solving production issues rather than
  writing real good development projects

#### Good names

Following good naming conventions can go a long way in making our code readable and maintainable.

Bad naming example:

```java
class CommonService { // what does this service do?
    Map<Integer, String> data; // what kind of data?

    public Map<String, String> data() { // get data?
        //....
    }
}
```

**Class names**

Classes and objects should have **noun** or noun phrase names. A class name should NOT be a verb. For ex: Customer, Dog,
House, WikiPage, Account, AddressParser, OrderAlgo, EmailSender etc.

It should be **specific** as well.

For example, class `CommonUtils` contains util methods for "anything" (number, String, time, etc.), and it is too broad.

```java
import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class CommonUtils {

    // number utils
    public static double getSquareRootPlusOne(final double num) {
        return Math.sqrt(num) + 1D;
    }

    public static int generateRandomNumberBetween(int low, int high) {
        return ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(high - low) + low;
    }

    // String util
    public static String encode(final String data) {
        final StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (final char ch : data.toCharArray()) {
            builder.append(Character.isLetter(ch) ? ch ^ ' ' : ch);
        }
        return builder.reverse().toString();
    }

    // time util
    public static void printCurrentLocalTimeInUTC() {
        final String now = Instant.now().atZone(ZoneId.of("UTC")).toString();
        System.out.println(now);
    }

}
```

It breaks the **Single Responsibility Principle** rule which is basics of SOLID design principles. It states that a
class should only have one responsibility and should only have one reason to change.

So we should break down this class into subclasses with concrete good names: `NumberUtils`, `StringUtils`, `TimeUtils`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class NumberUtils {

    public static double getSquareRootPlusOne(final double num) {
        return Math.sqrt(num) + 1D;
    }

    public static int generateRandomNumberBetween(int low, int high) {
        return ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(high - low) + low;
    }
}
```

```java
public class StringUtils {

    public static String encode(final String data) {
        final StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (final char ch : data.toCharArray()) {
            builder.append(Character.isLetter(ch) ? ch ^ ' ' : ch);
        }
        return builder.reverse().toString();
    }

}
```

```java
import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.ZoneId;

public class TimeUtils {

    public static void printCurrentLocalTimeInUTC() {
        final String now = Instant.now().atZone(ZoneId.of("UTC")).toString();
        System.out.println(now);
    }

}
```

To summarize, avoid ending class names as: `Coordinator`, `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` and always be more
specific.

Some alternatives are:

- Builder
- Factory
- Container
- Writer
- Reader
- Handler

There are quite a few design patterns used for creating objects: `Builder`, `Factory`,`Singleton`, etc.

Thus, we can use these patterns to create class names as:

```java
// OK, provides Order objects
class OrderFactory {
}
```

```java
// OK, builds a client with method chaining
class HttpClientBuilder {
}
```

**Variable names**

Variables in Java capture the state of the object created from a class. The name of the variable should describe the
intent of the variable clearly.

Few guidelines to check:

- use camelCase (Java convention)
- always specific
- never a single letter, except in case of loops like `for` or `foreach`
- should be only 1-2 words, do NOT use very long variable names
- booleans should be prefixed with "is" or "has": **isActive**, **isInterrupted**, **hasCompleted**, etc.
- use ALL_CAPS with underscores for static constants

For ex:

```
Map<Integer, String> d = getStuff(); // single letter 'd' - what does it mean? => never use
Map<Integer, String> data = getStuff(); // what data?
Map<Integer, String> tradeDetails = getStuff(); // correct - tradeDetails clearly indicates that its about trades data 
```

**Method names**

Few guidelines to check:

- name should reveal intent
- anyone can fully understand functionality from the name

In other words, if we have to look inside the method to understand what it does â€“ the name needs improvement.

Taking the same snippet of code as above, we can rename the `getStuff()` method:

```
Map<Integer, String> tradeDetails = getTradeDetails();
```

As methods are actions, we can follow these conventions:

| Verb (do what?) | Noun (to what?) | Method Name (Verb + Noun) |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| get             | TradeDetails    | getTradeDetails()         |
| convert         | Currency        | convertCurrency()         |
| create          | Order           | createOrder()             |
| generate        | RandomNumber    | generateRandomNumber()    |

Few more checks while defining a method and its name:

- avoid abbreviations => `getKms()`, `calculateKgs()`, `setLbs()` - do NOT use this
- avoid spelling errors, otherwise, it will be difficult to search in a large project
- similar to classes, a method should do only one thing and should only have one reason to change
- if a method does MORE than the name says or if it has the name which contains "and", "or", "if" => it should be split
  into smaller methods

For ex:

```
TradeDetails getTradeDetails() {
    // query DB
    // format data
    // precalculate
    // convertToLocalCurrency
}
```

Here, `getTradeDetails()` method is doing 3 or more independent things but the name only says to get trade details.

Thus, we can easily split this method into multiple smaller methods.

- only query DB should be put in the `getTradeDetails()`
- new methods for `formatTradeData()`, `precalculateTradeData()`, `convertToLocalCurrency()`

Do NOT use this: `getAndFormatAndPrecalculateAndConvertToLocalCurrencyTradeData()`

There are few exceptions for method names as we just discussed:

- Static factory methods
- Builder and Fluent design patterns
- Java Streams

```
orderList.stream()
        .map(func1.andThen(func2))
        .findAny()
        .orElseThrow(...);
```

To summarize, naming classes, methods, variables, is one of the most important factors for writing clean code.

|           |                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| Classes   | Single Responsibility and specific |
| Variables | Descriptive and concise            |
| Methods   | Reveal intent and no multi-tasking |
